# cybersecurity-threat-analysis

## Summary:

- Introduction: The notebook focuses on analyzing cybersecurity threat data, aiming to merge multiple CSV files, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to extract insights.
- Data Loading and Merging: Code cells demonstrate how to load and merge multiple CSV files from a directory into a single DataFrame.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Data Structure and Cleaning: Overview of the dataset structure, removal of unnecessary columns, and conversion of date columns to datetime format.
  - Descriptive Statistics and Visualization: Generating summary statistics and visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps to understand data distributions and relationships.
  - Correlation Analysis: Calculating and visualizing correlations between numerical variables using heatmaps.
- Statistical Analysis:
  - T-Test and Chi-Squared Test: Functions and code for performing t-tests and chi-squared tests to compare means and examine relationships between variables.
- Clustering and Pattern Recognition:
  - Hierarchical Clustering: Code for hierarchical clustering and dendrogram visualization.
  - Patch Time Analysis: Calculation and visualization of the time taken to patch vulnerabilities, including histogram plots and binning strategies.
- Insights and Findings:
  - Identified patterns and trends in the cybersecurity threat data, such as product and CWE rankings, and patch time distributions.
  - Highlighted the importance of specific features and their relationships to vulnerability patching.\
